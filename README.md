Synthetic TikTok - MYM-Z
Synthetic TikTok (MYM-Z) is an innovative project designed to emulate and analyze the dynamics
of TikTok-like platforms. The project combines synthetic data generation, user behavior modeling,
and platform analytics to explore trends, simulate interactions, and provide valuable insights
into social media patterns.
---
## Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create simulated user profiles, videos, interactions, and trends.
- **Platform Analytics**: Analyze engagement metrics, content virality, and user retention.
- **Behavioral Simulation**: Model user actions like likes, comments, and shares to understand
platform dynamics.
- **Customizable Framework**: Easily modify parameters for various scenarios or research needs.
- **Scalability**: Supports small-scale testing to large-scale simulations.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mymultiplatform/Synthetic-TikTok-mym-z.git
cd Synthetic-TikTok-mym-z

```
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Run the Application**:
```bash
python main.py
```
---
## Usage
- **Configuration**:
- Customize simulation parameters in the `config.yaml` file.
- Adjust user behavior, video generation, or trend analysis as needed.
- **Running Simulations**:

- Use `python run_simulation.py` to start a simulation session.
- Output data will be saved in the `output/` directory.
- **Visualization**:
- Analyze results with built-in tools by running:
```bash
python analyze.py
```
- View charts, graphs, and summaries in the `visualizations/` directory.
