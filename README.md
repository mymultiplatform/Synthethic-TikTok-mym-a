# Synthetic TikTok - MYM-Z

Synthetic TikTok (MYM-Z) is an innovative project designed to emulate and analyze the dynamics of TikTok-like platforms. It combines synthetic data generation, user behavior modeling, and platform analytics to explore trends, simulate interactions, and provide valuable insights into social media patterns.

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create simulated user profiles, videos, interactions, and trends.
- **Platform Analytics**: Analyze engagement metrics, content virality, and user retention.
- **Behavioral Simulation**: Model user actions like likes, comments, and shares to understand platform dynamics.
- **Customizable Framework**: Easily modify parameters for various scenarios or research needs.
- **Scalability**: Supports small-scale testing to large-scale simulations.
